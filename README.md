# Pi:Finder
You have a pile of Raspberry Pi's, Banana Pi's or any other single board computer like i do? Always have some trouble to find the right computer like i do? Then have a look at Pi:Finder!

## What is it?
Pi:Finder is a mix of a webpage, a shellscript and a small piece of hardware. It rebuilds the locator led from hp or ubiquiti unifi switches (or any other enterprise network hardware).
